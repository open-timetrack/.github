## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a project which provides a simple open source service to manage your "timetracks". 

E.g. if you have to keep note, when you start or stoped working on a specific task, you are able to keep track of that with these services. 

This project has also an educational view. I want to try out different backend implementations, mesure metrics for performance and resources of different implementations
and try integrating in different plattforms.
